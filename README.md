# Video-game-project
Hello. I am currently in project of making a video game and I would need six people, three to make the coding and three to make the art work. Since it's not a small project, I think it could take about four to five years. I'll also join in when I'm done learning JavaScript. Thank you for your answer. By the way, I am not 18 yet meaning that the only ressource you might get for a while will be the fun of working with your team. I won't put pressure, though you have a five year deadline.
